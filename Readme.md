# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Description
The removeDuplicates.py contains a solution to the "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array" problem, along with additional information such as the problem statement, examples, and constraints.

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

### Custom Judge
The judge will test your solution with the provided code snippet. If all assertions pass, your solution will be accepted.

```python
nums = [...] # Input array
expectedNums = [...] # The expected answer with correct length

k = removeDuplicates(nums) # Calls your implementation

k == expectedNums.length
for index in range(k) {
    nums[index] == expectedNums[index];
}

```
#### Example 1
<b>**Input:**</b> nums = [1,1,2] <br>
<b>Output:</b>2, nums = [1,2,_] <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. <br>
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores). <br>

#### Example 2:
<b>**Input:**</b> nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]<br>
<b>Output:</b> 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,,,,,_]<br>
<b>Explanation:</b> Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.<br>
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).<br>

# 27. Remove Element
## Description
The removeElement.py contains a solution to the "Remove Element" problem, along with additional information such as the problem statement, examples, and constraints.

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed. Then return `k` after removing all occurrences of `val` where `k` is the new length of the array after removal.

### Custom Judge
The judge will test your solution with the provided code snippet. If all assertions pass, your solution will be accepted.

```python
nums = [...] // Input array
val = ... // Value to remove
expectedNums = [...] // The expected answer with correct length

k = removeElement(nums, val) // Calls your implementation

k == expectedNums.length
for index in range(k) {
    nums[index] == expectedNums[index];
}
```
#### Example 1
<b>**Input:**</b> nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3 <br>
<b>Output:</b> 2, nums = [2,2,,] <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2 and 2 respectively. <br>
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores). <br>

#### Example 2:
<b>**Input:**</b> nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2<br>
<b>Output:</b> 5, nums = [0,1,3,0,4,,,,,_]<br>
<b>Explanation:</b> Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4 respectively.<br>
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).<br>

Specifically, `ans` is the concatenation of two `nums` arrays.

Return the array `ans`.

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
nums = [1,2,1]
```
**Output:** 
```python
ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]
```
**Explanation:** 
The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]]
- ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]

#### Example 2:

**Input:** 
```python
nums = [1,3,2,1]
```
**Output:** 
```python
ans = [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
```
**Explanation:** 
The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3]]
- ans = [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]

## Constraints:

# 682. Baseball Game
### Problem Statement
You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.<br>
You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]`is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:<br>

- An integer x: Record a new score of x.
- '+': Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- 'D': Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- 'C': Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
```
**Output:** 
```python
30
```
**Explanation:** 
- "5": Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
- "2": Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
- "C": Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
- "D": Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
- "+": Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].<br>
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

#### Example 2:

**Input:** 
```python
ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
```
**Output:** 
```python
27
```

**Explanation:**
- "5": Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
- "-2": Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
- "4": Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
- "C": Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
- "D": Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
- "9": Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
- "+": Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
- "+": Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.

## Constraints:
- 1 <= operations.length <= 1000
- operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or a string representing an integer in the range [-3 * 10^4, 3 * 10^4].
- For operation "+", there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
- For operations "C" and "D", there will always be at least one previous score on the record.

# 20. Valid Parentheses
Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
s = "()"
```
**Output:** 
```python
true
```
#### Example 2:

# 707. Design Linked List
Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.<br>
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.<br>
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

## Implement the MyLinkedList class:

- int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
- void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
- void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.
- void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
- void deleteAtIndex(int index) Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
["MyLinkedList", "addAtHead", "addAtTail", "addAtIndex", "get", "deleteAtIndex", "get"]
[[], [1], [3], [1, 2], [1], [1], [1]]

# 1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch
The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers `0` and `1` respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.<br>

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a <b>stack</b>. At each step:<br>

- If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
- Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.<br>

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.<br>

You are given two integer arrays `students` and `sandwiches` where `sandwiches[i]` is the type of the `i​​​​​​th` sandwich in the stack (`i = 0` is the top of the stack) and `students[j]` is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (`j = 0` is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.


#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
students = [1,1,0,0]
sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
```
**Output:** 
```python
0
```
##### Explanation:
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1] and sandwiches = [1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [] and sandwiches = [].<br>
Hence all students are able to eat.

##### Constraints
- 1 <= students.length, sandwiches.length <= 100
- students.length == sandwiches.length
- sandwiches[i] is 0 or 1.
- students[i] is 0 or 1.

# 225. Implement Stack using Queues
Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).<br>

Implement the MyStack class:<br>

- void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
- int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
- int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
- boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

##### Notes:
- You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid. <br>
- Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations. <br>
#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
```
**Output:** 
```python
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]
```
##### Explanation:
- MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
- myStack.push(1);
- myStack.push(2);
- myStack.top(); // return 2
- myStack.pop(); // return 2
- myStack.empty(); // return False

##### Constraints
-  <= x <= 9
- At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
- All the calls to pop and top are valid.

# 509. Fibonacci Number
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,<br>

# 771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.<br>

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.


#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
jewels = "aA"
stones = "aAAbbbb"
```
**Output:** 
```python
3
```

##### Constraints

You are given the `root` of a binary tree that consists of exactly `3 `nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.<br>


Return `true` if the value of the root is equal to the sum of the values of its two children, or `false` otherwise.<br>


#### Example 1
**Input:**
```python
root = [10,4,6]
```
**Output:** 
```python
true
```
<br>

##### Explanation:
